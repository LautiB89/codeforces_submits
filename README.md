# My CodeForces Submits
Here i will upload my [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/) submissions and group them by difficulty.  
I'll try too use `Python` or `C++`.  
I'm doing these to practice and improve my problem solving skills.
Feel free to pull a request in case you know a better way of solving a problem :)
